Step1: Download the zip from our github page of the Master branch.

Step2: Make sure Python is installed!! Open our program in any IDE. If for some reason your python does not come with tkinter downloaded,
       download tkinter and then tkdesigner and Cryptography. Double check to see if all the folders match with github (team 
       members had trouble with some folders not being replicated). Each package can either be installed through pip or manually.
       If you have trouble downloading any packages, it is not our programs doin.

Step3: Run the program from Main.py only!! Do not run from any other file otherwise it will result in an error.

Step4: Create an account or Login to your existing account! Enjoy your Key Notebook and have fun exploring!
